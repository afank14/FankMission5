            Soccer is really fun! Do you think soccer is fun? I hope you think soccer is fun! I think soccer is really fun
            because I get to kick a ball as hard as I can. It is really fun to score goals and to get assists. I have been
            playing soccer since I was 3 years old. 5 of my 7 older siblings also played soccer, so you could say it runs
            in the family. Currently, I play for the BYU Men's Soccer team. It is a blast!

            Something that I think you should know is that soccer, when played right, is the best sport in the world. That's
            technically an opinion, so please do not dock me points for that. Seriously, I get chills at least once a week from
            watching soccer. Anyways, I can train you if you'd like! Go on over to the pricing page to see how much it'd cost you!
